## Introduction

> *Dealing with concurrency becomes hard when we lack the ‘working knowledge’ and best practices are not followed. ‒ Ramith Jayasinghe, Experienced Software Engineer.*

A brief description about the generic terms of concurrency and parallelism, multitasking styles, and task bounds to first make understand the basic concepts of concurrency and parallelism will be given in this material. The story of Python interpreter implementation for embracing concurrency will also be given. Popular Python built-in packages for concurrent programming (i.e. multithreading, multiprocessing, and asyncio) will be shown, given some minimum working example. At last by this material, choosing what is the best concurrent programming approach for many projects and extending into more wild 3rd party packages for the sake of concurrency will be easier.

The aim of this material is to educate Indonesian Pythonista about concurrency and parallelism in (C)Python, so the resources mostly given in Bahasa Indonesia.
